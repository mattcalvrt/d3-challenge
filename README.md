# d3-challenge
The purpose of this project is to build an interactive dashboard using D3 and Plotly JavaScript libraries to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Location of files and folders:
- JavaScript file:  ***app.js*** located in the **static/js** folder
- HTML file that loads and executes the JavaScript file: ***index.html***
- JSON file with the sample data (for reference only): ***samples.json***
- Github Pages site with the dashboard: https://mattcalvrt.github.io/d3-challenge/
